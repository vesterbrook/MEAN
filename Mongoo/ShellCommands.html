Creating a database using mongo and using the terminal.


enter the mongo shell
1.create a database called "my_first_db"
// I used "use my_first_db" as a command. Because there wasnt a db named that it automatically created one for me. 
2. Create students collection
//db.createCollection("students)
3.Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
//db.students.insert({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday{month:NUMBER, day:NUMBER, year:NUNMBER}}) 
4. create 5 students with the above info. 
//see answer 3
5.get all students
//db.students.find().pretty()
6. retrieve all students who are from california
//db.students.find({home_state: "california"}).pretty()
7.Get all students whose lucky number is:
greater than 3
less than or equal to 10
between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
// students whose fave number is greater than 3-> db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}}).pretty()
//less trhan of equal to 10 -> db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte:10}}).pretty()
//between  1 and 9 COME BACK
8.Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
//db.students.update({}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "mongo"]}}, false, true)
9.Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
